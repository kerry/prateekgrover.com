<center>An enterprise SDK for developers to integrate iFlyLab's product iFlyChat in iOS applications.</center>
     
 The SDK was written completely in Objective-C while I was working as a mobile application developer in iFlyLabs.

      
## Key Points:
* Used [SocketRocket](https://github.com/facebook/SocketRocket), a popular library to integrate websockets in iOS applications.
* Created a framework so that the SDK can be easily integrated by other developers.
* Used iOS notifications to communicate between different components of SDK, which really helped in creating a highly modular and loosely bound structure.
