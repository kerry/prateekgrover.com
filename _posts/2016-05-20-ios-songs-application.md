<center>This is the official iOS application of Routofy, which is a travel startup based out of Delhi, India.</center>
     
 The application was made completely in Swift while working as a mobile application developer in Routofy.

      
## Key Points:
* Used [RestKit](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit), a popular library to convert JSON objects to native objects.
* Integrated Google, Facebook and usual username-password login system.
* Extensive use of dynamically created UI elements to cater to the dynamic nature of data.
* Integrated analytics tools like Google Analytics and Amplitude.
* Integrated crash analytics tool Bugsnag.
* Integrated Branch to create deep link URLs.
