Hey, there!

My name is Prateek Grover and I am a freelance mobile application developer. I have been in the field for nearly 2 years, and have been loving every minute of it.

I graduated in 2014 from BITS-Pilani with a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Electricals.

Intrigued by the potential of mobile applications, I delved into learning Android development and soon I got an opportunity to work as an Android developer and started learning iOS development.

I am currently working as a mobile application developer in Routofy, a travel startup based in New Delhi.

To know more, have a look at few of my [projects](/projects) and [work experience](/work)

## Say Hi!
